## Motivation

I built this project to strengthen my core frontend skills using plain HTML, CSS, and jQuery, with a particular focus on modern layout techniques such as CSS Grid and Flexbox.  
The goal was to create a visually structured website without relying on frameworks or build tools.

## Features

- Responsive gallery layout built with CSS Grid
- Dropdown navigation buttons
- “Exhibit of the Month” highlight page
- About Us informational page
- Mobile-friendly layout adjustments

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for semantic structure
- **CSS3**
  - Grid for gallery and page layout
  - Flexbox for component alignment
- **jQuery** for interactive UI behavior and responsive adjustments

## Architecture / Design Decisions

- The project is implemented as a static website to keep the structure simple and accessible.
- CSS Grid is used for the main gallery layout to allow flexible control over rows and columns.
- Flexbox is used for navigation elements and UI components where one-dimensional alignment is more appropriate.
- jQuery is used selectively to manage dropdown interactions and layout behavior on smaller screen sizes.

- Choosing between Grid and Flexbox depending on layout requirements
- Handling responsive behavior for screen widths below 700px and 500px
